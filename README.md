<h1 align="center">Stock Market Prediction using LSTM ðŸ“ˆ</h1>

This repository contains the code for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to forecast stock prices and optimize trading decisions, as well as to provide data on standard moving averages and other commonly used indicators.

Historical stock market data is used to train the LSTM model. The model learns from past price patterns and trends. The LSTM network has proven to be effective in time series forecasting tasks.

## Dataset
I used a publicly available dataset from yfinance.

## Model Training
The LSTM model is built using frameworks such as tensorflow, pandas, numpy.

Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance with various metrics and visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices using matplotib.
